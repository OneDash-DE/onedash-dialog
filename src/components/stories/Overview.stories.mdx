# React.js dialog component

This guide will help you render dialog components with React.js.
If you're not familiar with setting up a new React web project, please refer to the React documentation.

## Install

In order to install the components run the following:

```bash
npm install onedash-dialog
```

## Usage

All the described components can be imported from "onedash-dialog".

_Example:_

```javascript

```

## Styling

Most components come without any style. You can adjust it yourself by CSS. If you like the style in this documentation, you can use our stylesheet from [here](https://github.com/OneDash-DE/onedash-dialog/blob/master/src/components/stories/dialog.sass).
